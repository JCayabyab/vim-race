# VimRace GitHub Repository

This project was started in May 2020. You may try out the live version [here](http://www.vimrace.com).

The website was built with PostgreSQL, Node + Express, and React 16. Communication during the game uses socket.io, and the Vim terminal uses the [rhysd/react-vim-wasm](https://github.com/rhysd/react-vim-wasm) library.

If you find any bugs, you can report them in the Issues section of this repository.
